# Description

* This is a random color generator I made that reveals each color's hex number on a hover. This is meant to aid designers in finding and saving colors and color combos to use in their work. 

## How it Works

* This app makes an AJAX call to https://api.noopschallenge.com/hexbot which returns random colors one by one. Each is rendered in its own small square, appearing sequentially right to left, on a button click.
